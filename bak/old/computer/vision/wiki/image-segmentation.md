In computer vision, image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments (sets of pixels, also known as image objects). The goal of segmentation is to simplify and/or change the representation of an image into something that is more maeningful and easier to analyze. Image segmentation is typically used to locate objects and boundaries (lines, curves, etc.) in images. More precisely image segmentation is the process of assigning a label to every pixel in an image such that pixels with the same label share certain characteristics.

The result of image segmentation is a set of segments that collectively cover the entire image, or a set of contours extracted from the image. Each of the pixels in a region are similar with respect to some characteristics or computed property, such as color, intensity, or texture. Adjacent regions are significantly different with respect to the same characteristics. When applied to a stack of images, typical in medical imaging, the resulting contours after image segmentation can be used to create three-dimensional rectructions with the help of interpolation algorithms like marching cubes.

## APPLICATIONS

content-based image retrieval, machine visino, medical imaging, object detection, recoginition tasks, traffic control systems, video surveillance, video object co-segmentation and action localization.

## METHODS

### THRESHOLDING

The simplest method of image segmentation is called the thresholding method. This method is based on a clip level (or a threshold value) to turn a gray scale image into a binary image.
