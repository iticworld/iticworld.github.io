## 1.1. INTRODUCTION

Many familiar physical notations, such as forces, velocities, and accelerations, involve both a magnitude (the amount of the force, velocity, or acceleration) and a direction. __Any such entity involving both magnitude and direction is called a vector. A vector is represented by an arrow whose length denotes the magnitude of the vector and whose direction represents the direction of the vector.__ In most physical situations involving vectors, only the magnitude and direction of the vector are significant; consequently, we regard vectors with the same magnitude and direction as being equal irrespective of their positions. In this section the geometric of vectors is discussed. This geometry is derived from physical experiments that test the manner in which two vectors interact.

Familiar situations suggest that when two like physical quantities act simultaneously at a point, the magnitude of their effect need not equal the sum of the magnitudes of the original quantities. For example, a swimmer swimming upstream at the rate of 2 miles per hour against a current of 1 mile per hour does not progress at the rate of 3 miles per hour. For in this instance the motions of the swimmer and current oppose each other, and the rate of progress of the swimmer is only 1 mile per hour upstream. If, however, the swimmer is moving downstream (with the current), then his or her rate of progress is 3 miles per hour downstream.

Experiments show that if two like quantities act together, their effect is predictable. In this case, the vectors used to represent these quantities can be combined to form a resultant vector that represents the combined effects of the original quantities. This resultant vector is called the sum of the original vectors, and the rule for their combination is called the parallelogram law.

__Parallelogram Law for Vector Addition__

The sum of two vectors <math><semantics><mi>x</mi></semantics></math> and <math><semantics><mi>y</mi></semantics></math> that act at the same point <math><semantics><mi>P</mi></semantics></math> is the vector beginning at <math><semantics><mi>P</mi></semantics></math> that is represented by the diagonal of parallelogram having <math><semantics><mi>x</mi></semantics></math> and <math><semantics><mi>y</mi></semantics></math> as adjacent sides.

---

Since opposite sides of a parallelogram are parallel and of equal length, the endpoint <math><semantics><mi>Q</mi></semantics></math> of the arrow representing <math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">+</mo><mi>y</mi></mrow></semantics></math> can also be obtained by allowing <math><semantics><mi>x</mi></semantics></math> to act at <math><semantics><mi>P</mi></semantics></math> and then allowing <math><semantics><mi>y</mi></semantics></math> to act at the endpoint of <math><semantics><mi>x</mi></semantics></math>. Similarly, the end point of the vector <math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">+</mo><mi>y</mi></mrow></semantics></math> can be obtained by first permitting <math><semantics><mi>y</mi></semantics></math> to act at <math><semantics><mi>P</mi></semantics></math> and the allowing <math><semantics><mi>x</mi></semantics></math> to act at the endpoint of <math><semantics><mi>y</mi></semantics></math>. Thus two vectors <math><semantics><mi>x</mi></semantics></math> and <math><semantics><mi>y</mi></semantics></math> that both act at the point <math><semantics><mi>P</mi></semantics></math> may be added "tail-to-head"; that is, either <math><semantics><mi>x</mi></semantics></math> or <math><semantics><mi>y</mi></semantics></math> may be applied at <math><semantics><mi>P</mi></semantics></math> and a vector having the same magnitude and direction as the other may be applied to the endpoint of the first. If this is done, the endpoint of the second vector is the endpoint of <math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">+</mo><mi>y</mi></mrow></semantics></math>.

The addition of vectors can be described algebraically with the use of analytic geometry. In the plane containing <math><semantics><mi>x</mi></semantics></math> and <math><semantics><mi>y</mi></semantics></math>, introduce a coordinate system with <math><semantics><mi>P</mi></semantics></math> at the origin. Let <math><semantics><mrow><mo fence="true" stretchy="false">(</mo><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>a</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mi>,</mi><msub><mi>a</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow></mrow><mo fence="true" stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></semantics></math> denote the endpoint of <math><semantics><mi>x</mi></semantics></math> and <math><semantics><mrow><mo fence="true" stretchy="false">(</mo><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>b</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mi>,</mi><msub><mi>b</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow></mrow><mo fence="true" stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></semantics></math> denote the endpoint of <math><semantics><mi>y</mi></semantics></math>. Then as Figure 1.2.1 shows, the endpoint <math><semantics><mi>Q</mi></semantics></math> of <math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">+</mo><mi>y</mi></mrow></semantics></math> is <math><semantics><mrow><mo fence="true" stretchy="false">(</mo><mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>a</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">+</mo><msub><mi>b</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><mi>,</mi><mrow><msub><mi>a</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">+</mo><msub><mi>b</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo fence="true" stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></semantics></math>. Henceforth, when a reference is made to the coordinates of the endpoint of a vector, the vector should be assumed to emanate from the origin. Moreover, since a vector beginning at the origin is completely determined by its endpoint, we sometimes refer the the point <math><semantics><mi>x</mi></semantics></math> rather the endpoint of the vector <math><semantics><mi>x</mi></semantics></math> if <math><semantics><mi>x</mi></semantics></math> is a vector emanating from the origin.

Besides the operation of vector addition, there is another natural operation that can be performed on vectors - length of a vector may be magnified or contracted. This operation, called scalar multiplication, consists of multiplying the vector by a real number. If the vector <math><semantics><mi>x</mi></semantics></math> is represented by an arrow, then for any real number <math><semantics><mi>t</mi></semantics></math>, the vector <math><semantics><mi>tx</mi></semantics></math> is represented by an arrow in the same direction if <math><semantics><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy="false">≥</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></semantics></math> and in the opposite direction if <math><semantics><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy="false">&lt;</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></semantics></math>. The length of the arrow <math><semantics><mi>tx</mi></semantics></math> is <math><semantics><mrow><mo fence="true" stretchy="false">|</mo><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow><mo fence="true" stretchy="false">|</mo></mrow></semantics></math> times the length of the arrow <math><semantics><mi>x</mi></semantics></math>. Two non-zero vectors <math><semantics><mi>x</mi></semantics></math> and <math><semantics><mi>y</mi></semantics></math> are called parallel if <math><semantics><mrow><mi>y</mi><mo stretchy="false">=</mo><mi mathvariant="italic">tx</mi></mrow></semantics></math> for some non-zero real number <math><semantics><mi>t</mi></semantics></math>. Thus non-zero vectors having the same or opposite directions are parallel.

To describe scalar multiplication algebraically, again introduce a coordinate system into a plane containing the vector <math><semantics><mi>x</mi></semantics></math> so that <math><semantics><mi>x</mi></semantics></math> emanates from the origin. If the endpoint of <math><semantics><mi>x</mi></semantics></math> has coordinates <math><semantics><mrow><mo fence="true" stretchy="false">(</mo><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>a</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mi>,</mi><msub><mi>a</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow></mrow><mo fence="true" stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></semantics></math>, then the coordinates of the endpoint of <math><semantics><mi mathvariant="italic">tx</mi></semantics></math> are easily seen to be (ta_1, ta_2).

The algebraic descriptions of vector addition and scalar multiplication for vectors in a plane yield the following properties:
